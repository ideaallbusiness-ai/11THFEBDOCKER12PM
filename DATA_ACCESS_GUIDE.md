## 🔍 Technical Details (API Working Perfectly)

If you're curious about the technical side:

```bash
# Test API endpoints directly:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/queries | jq
curl http://localhost:3000/api/organizations | jq
curl http://localhost:3000/api/packages | jq
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users | jq

# Verify Supabase connection:
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-supabase | jq
```

All endpoints are returning data correctly. The frontend just requires authentication (login) to display it for security reasons.
